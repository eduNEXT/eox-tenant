This file implements the Middleware support for the Open edX platform.
A microsite enables the following features:

1) Mapping of sub-domain name to a 'brand', e.g. foo-university.edx.org
2) Present a landing page with a listing of courses that are specific to the 'brand'
3) Ability to swap out some branding elements in the website
