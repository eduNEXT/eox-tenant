# NOTE: Pylint 4.x introduces changes in how the "ignore" and "ignore-patterns" options
# are parsed from setup.cfg and other configuration files. This causes Django migration
# modules (e.g., eox_tenant/migrations) to be linted even when explicitly ignored.
# Until we find a stable fix or plugin-based workaround, we keep Pylint pinned below 4.
